## Introduction[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#introduction)

**ETDP** (_Economic Transformation Database_) provides comprehensive, long-term, and internationally comparable sectoral data on employment and productivity in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. [ETD â€“ Economic Transformation Database](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/etd-economic-transformation-database).

## Concept[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#concept)

Structural transformation â€” when an economy shifts from predominantly low-productivity sectors to those of higher productivity â€” is a central feature of economic development. This change often involves the emergence and expansion of new industries that can contribute to better jobs and improved livelihoods.

Looking at how the structures of economies transform over time can provide precious insights on how especially developing economies, in particular low-income, can achieve sustainable, inclusive development.

## More than embedded[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#more-than-embedded)
The ETD is also accessible through [Download the database](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/structuralchange/etd/).


> ðŸ’¡ Other outputs of the joint project include two working papers on insights into economic transformation.

Key questions:
* What is the industrialization experience of developing economies in recent decades?
* What is the relation between growth, female labour force participation, poverty reduction and sectoral patterns of employment and production?
* Can countries achieve growth, provide good jobs, and reduce poverty without industrialization?
* Can modern agriculture and modern services serve as an alternative mechanism of structural transformation and economic growth?
