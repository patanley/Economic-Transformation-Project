## Introduction[![](https://github.com/patanley/TrendChart/blob/main/Images/pin.svg)](#overview)

**WDI** (_World Development Indicators_) provides comprehensive, long-term, and internationally comparable sectoral data on employment and productivity in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. [World Development Indicators](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712).

## Objective[![](https://github.com/patanley/TrendChart/blob/main/Images/pin.svg)](#overview)
The objective of this data analytics project is to analyze and visualize the concept of economic growth, its definition, measurement, and the challenges associated with it. The project also aims to explore the historical perspective of economic growth and the inequalities that exist between different regions in terms of prosperity and economic development, using time series with annual data from 1990 until 2021. 

The project will focus on identifying patterns and trends in economic growth by analysing GDP growth and GDP per capita growth over time, highlighting the most significant countries driving growth in the targeted regions. By leveraging data analytics tools, this project will provide valuable insights to inform policy-making and business decisions for promoting economic development and job creation in these regions.

## Problem Statement[![](https://github.com/patanley/TrendChart/blob/main/Images/pin.svg)](#overview)

The problem statement for this data analytics project is to investigate the structural transformation of economies over time, particularly in developing countries and low-income economies. Structural transformation is a key aspect of economic development that involves shifting from low-productivity sectors to those of higher productivity, often resulting in the emergence and expansion of new industries that can contribute to better jobs and improved livelihoods.

## Urbanization and prosperity[![](https://github.com/patanley/TrendChart/blob/main/Images/pin.svg)](#overview)

> ðŸ’¡Urbanization and economic prosperity are strongly correlated as the following visualization shows. In most countries with a GDP per capita higher than 20,000     international-$ more than 60% of the population lives in cities.

## Use Case[![](https://github.com/patanley/TrendChart/blob/main/Images/pin.svg)](#overview)

> ðŸ’¡ Ultimately, the results of this project can inform policymakers, business leaders, and development practitioners on strategies for promoting economic growth and improving livelihoods in developing countries.

Key questions:
* What is the correlation between urbanization and economic prosperity, and how does it differ across countries with varying levels of GDP per capita?
* How has the historical perspective of economic growth shaped the current state of prosperity and economic development in different regions?
* What are the main factors contributing to the inequalities that exist between regions in terms of economic development and prosperity?

## Method[![](https://github.com/patanley/TrendChart/blob/main/Images/pin.svg)](#overview)

> ðŸ’¡ Steps

`Load data` as CSV

`Load data to ETL` to create a pipeline that ensures the data is accurate, consistent, and usable for analysis and reporting purposes. 
  * Buid the necessary dimensions and
  * Build a fact table

`Load the data into a SQL database:` Once the data has been transformed, it needs to be loaded into a SQL database so that it can be easily queried and analyzed. 

`Write SQL queries to extract data:` Once the data is loaded into a SQL database, you will need to write SQL queries to extract the data you need for your dashboard.     This can involve selecting specific columns, filtering data based on certain criteria, and aggregating data to create summary metrics. Create a star schema.

`Connect to Power BI:` Once you have extracted the data using SQL queries, you will need to connect to Power BI. This can be done using the Power BI Desktop            application or the Power BI Service.

`Create visualizations:` Once you have connected to Power BI, you can start creating visualizations for your dashboard. This can involve creating charts, graphs, and tables that display the data in a meaningful way.

`Add interactivity:` Once you have created your visualizations, you can add interactivity to your dashboard. This can involve adding filters, slicers, and drill-downs that allow users to explore the data in more detail.
